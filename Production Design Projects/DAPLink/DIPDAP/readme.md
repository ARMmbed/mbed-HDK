## DIPDAP

The DIPDAP is a debug probe based on the NXP LPC11U35, supported by the DAPLink project. It provides drag and drop programming to a various target MCUs, CMSIS-DAP interface for debugging and UART. All broken out to 2.54mm headers.

## Whats included here?

* Eagle Schematic and Board files
* PDF Schematic and Board copies
* CAM Job GERBERS for manufacture (including pick/place and drill)
* BOM (Bill of Materials)
* eBOM (An online BOM for easy purchasing!)

## Hardware

The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK and are referenced by their most up-to-date version v’x.x.x’. (If you wish to find an older project version, navigate to releases or checkout a previous commit). 

The design features:

        1. NXP LPC11U35; ARM Cortex-M0; 50MHz, 64kB Flash, 12kB SRAM 

## eBOM

In the HDK we provide an eBOM (Online BOM) for each production design project. This regulary updated eBOM gives the user a precompiled online list for purchasing all of the components in the design in one easy click saving you a wealth of time!

The eBOM for this project can be found [here](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/W1r7B13t)

## Software and more info

The software and more info can be found [coming soon](). 

## How to get hardware

1. Buy pre-assembled board from
