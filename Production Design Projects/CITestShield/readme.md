## CI Test Shield

The CI Test shield is used to verify the the peripherals in a software port of mbed-os for a new board. External peripherals like PWM, Digital IO, I2C, SPI ... are all tested with the CI Test shield.

## Whats included here?

* Eagle Schematic and Board files
* PDF Schematic and Board copies
* CAM Job GERBERS for manufacture (including pick/place and drill)
* BOM (Bill of Materials)
* eBOM (An online BOM for easy purchasing!)

## Hardware

The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK and are referenced by their most up-to-date version v’x.x.x’.(If you wish to find an older project version, navigate to releases or checkout a previous commit).

## eBOM

In the HDK we provide an eBOM (Online BOM) for each production design project. This regulary updated eBOM gives the user a precompiled online list for purchasing all of the components in the design in one easy click saving you a wealth of time!

The eBOM for this project can be found [here](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/ZgvU783O)

## Software and more info

The software for tests and more info can be found in the [CI Test Shield github repository](http://www.github.com/armmbed/ci-test-shield). 

## How to get hardware

1. Buy pre-assembled board from vendor (todo)
2. Do it yourself, order [PCB from OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/aOdUcwq7) and parts from the BOM or eBOM.
