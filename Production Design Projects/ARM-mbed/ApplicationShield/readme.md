## Whats included here?

* Eagle Schematic and Board files
* PDF Schematic and Board copies
* CAM Job GERBERS for manufacture (including pick/place and drill)
* BOM (Bill of Materials
* eBOM (An online BOM for easy purchasing!)

## Hardware

The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK and are referenced by their most up-to-date version v’x.x.x’. (If you wish to find an older project version, navigate to releases or checkout a previous commit). 

The design features:

        1. 128x32 Graphics LCD
        2. 5 way joystick
        3. 2 x Potentiometers
        4. Speaker, PWM Conencted
        5. 3 Axis +/1 1.5g Accelerometer
        6. RGB LED, PWM connected
        7. Temperature sensor
        8. Socket for for Xbee (Zigbee) or RN-XV (Wifi)

## eBOM

In the HDK we provide an eBOM (Online BOM) for each production design project. This regulary updated eBOM gives the user a precompiled online list for purchasing all of the components in the design in one easy click saving you a wealth of time!

The eBOM for this project can be found [here](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/2qbjfwtW)


## Software and more info

The software and more info can be found in the [mbed component page](https://developer.mbed.org/components/mbed-Application-Shield/). 

## How to get hardware

1. Buy pre-assembled board from:
  * [Cool Components](http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/mbed-application-shield.html)
  * [Switch Science](http://international.switch-science.com/catalog/1810/)
  * [Farnell](http://uk.farnell.com/keil/mbed-016-1/application-shield-arduino-dev/dp/2468119)
2. Do it yourself, using supplied GERBERS and BOM/eBOM with fabrication house.
