## SWDAP

The SWDAP is a debug probe based on the NXP LPC11U35, supported by the DAPLink project. It provides drag and drop programming to various target MCUs, and a CMSIS-DAP interface.

* The **SWDAP** does not allow debugging and testing through UART. However, our identical [DIDAP](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-HDK/tree/master/Production%20Design%20Projects/DAPLink/DIPDAP) does.

## Whats included here?

* Eagle Schematic and Board files
* PDF Schematic and Board copies
* CAM Job GERBERS for manufacture (including pick/place and drill)
* BOM (Bill of Materials)
* eBOM (An online BOM for easy purchasing!)

## Hardware

The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK and are referenced by their most up-to-date version v’x.x.x’. (If you wish to find an older project version, navigate to releases or checkout a previous commit). 

The design features:

        1. NXP LPC11U35; ARM Cortex-M0; 50MHz, 64kB Flash, 12kB SRAM 

## eBOM

In the HDK we provide an eBOM (Online BOM) for each production design project. This regulary updated eBOM gives the user a precompiled online list for purchasing all of the components in the design in one easy click saving you a wealth of time!

The eBOM for this project can be found [here](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/sm5lWPcq)

## Software and more info

The software and more info can be found in the [mbed platform page](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/SWDAP-LPC11U35/). 

## How to get hardware

1. Buy pre-assembled board from   
  * [FIREFLY IOT](https://firefly-iot.com/product/firefly-swdap-interface/)
  * [RS Online](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/9054104/)
2. Do it yourself, using supplied GERBERS and BOM/eBOM with fabrication house.
