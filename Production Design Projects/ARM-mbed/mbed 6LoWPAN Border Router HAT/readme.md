## Hardware

The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK and are referenced by their most up-to-date version v’x.x.x’. (If you wish to find an older project version, navigate to releases or checkout a previous commit). 

The design features:

        1. NXP MK64F; ARM Cortex-M4F processor; 120MHz, 1Mb Flash, 256kB SRAM
        2. Atmel ATZB-RF-233; 2,4GHz, 802.15.4 Radio
        3. DAPLink interface, running on NXP LPC11U35 (Drag and drop programming, CMSIS-DAP Debug, USB COM Port)

## eBOM

In the HDK we provide an eBOM (Online BOM) for each production design project. This regulary updated eBOM gives the user a precompiled online list for purchasing all of the components in the design in one easy click saving you a wealth of time!

The eBOM for this project can be found [here](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/ETAd8Lc3)
