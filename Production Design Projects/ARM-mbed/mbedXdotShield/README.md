## mbedXdotShield

The mbed xDOT shield features a Multitech xDOT LORA module, with mbed compatabile drag-drop programming. This device is both a independent platform or can act as a shield to make any device send or recieve LORA data via UART.

## Whats included here?

* Eagle Schematic and Board files
* PDF Schematic and Board copies
* CAM Job GERBERS for manufacture (including pick/place and drill)
* BOM (Bill of Materials)
* eBOM (An online BOM for easy purchasing!)

The design features:

        1. Multitech xDOT module: ST ARM® Cortex® M3 processor (STM32L151CCU6)
        2. DAPLink Interface LPC11u35: Drag Drop programming
        3. 868/915MHz LoRa chip antenna
        4. AT45DB161E-SSHD-T Serial Flash
        5. 3V JST-PH Battery connector
        6. Arduino style headers: Allowing device to operate as LoRa shield
        7. UART swap: Slide switch, allowing UART TX/RX to be swapped, if using as shield switch to 'On'

## Hardware

The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK and are referenced by their most up-to-date version v’x.x.x’.(If you wish to find an older project version, navigate to releases or checkout a previous commit).

## eBOM

In the HDK we provide an eBOM (Online BOM) for each production design project. This regulary updated eBOM gives the user a precompiled online list for purchasing all of the components in the design in one easy click saving you a wealth of time!

The eBOM for this project can be found [here]()

## Software and more info

The software for tests and more info can be found in the [CI Test Shield github repository](http://www.github.com/armmbed/ci-test-shield). 

## How to get hardware

1. Buy pre-assembled board from vendor (todo)
2. Do it yourself
